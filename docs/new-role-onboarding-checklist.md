## Clarifying Responsibilities and Handoffs

As you onboard, use this framework to clarify who owns what and how work flows between roles:

### Questions to Ask
1. **Ownership**: Who is the DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) for this decision or deliverable?
2. **Handoffs**: At what point do I hand off work to the next role? What format should it be in?
3. **Inputs**: What do I need from others to do my job effectively?
4. **Outputs**: What do others need from me, and in what format?
5. **Escalation**: When should I escalate issues, and to whom?
6. **Communication**: What meetings should I attend, and what updates should I provide?

### Example Handoff Scenarios

**Product Manager → UX Designer:**
- **What**: User stories with problem statement and success criteria
- **When**: During sprint planning or design phase
- **Format**: Written requirements with user research insights
